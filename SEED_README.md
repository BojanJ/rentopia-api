## How to Run

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure your database is running (PostgreSQL)
2. Ensure your `.env` file has the correct `DATABASE_URL`
3. Run database migrations first: `npm run db:push`

### Run the Seed Script

```bash
cd backend
npm run db:seed
```

### What Happens When You Run It

1. **Data Cleanup** - All existing data is cleared first
2. **User Creation** - Admin user is created with hashed password
3. **Property Setup** - 3 properties with different characteristics
4. **Service Provider Network** - 5 providers across different services
5. **Booking History** - Realistic booking timeline (past, current, future)
6. **Maintenance Workflow** - Various task types and statuses
7. **Financial Tracking** - Payment records for bookings and tasks

### Data Relationships

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**

   ```
   Error: P1001: Can't reach database server
   ```

   - Check if PostgreSQL is running
   - Verify DATABASE_URL in .env file

2. **Permission Errors**

   ```
   Error: Permission denied
   ```

   - Ensure database user has CREATE/DROP permissions
   - Check if database exists

3. **Type Errors**
   ```
   Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Date'
   ```
   - Usually indicates a Prisma schema mismatch
   - Run `npm run db:generate` to regenerate client

### Reset Database

If you need to start fresh:

```bash
npm run db:reset  # Resets database and runs migrations
npm run db:seed   # Re-runs seed script
```

### Inspect Data

Use Prisma Studio to browse the seeded data:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

## Customization

To modify the seed data:

1. Edit `prisma/seed.ts`
2. Adjust property details, booking dates, or service providers
3. Re-run: `npm run db:seed`

The script is idempotent - it clears existing data first, so it's safe to run multiple times during development.
